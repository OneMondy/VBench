# :bookmark_tabs: Prompt Suite

We design compact yet representative prompts in terms of both the evaluation dimensions and the content categories.

- `prompts/prompts_per_dimension`: For each VBench evaluation dimension, we carefully designed a set of around 100 prompts as the test cases.
- `prompts/prompts_per_category`: 100 prompts for each of the 8 content categories: `Animal`, `Architecture`, `Food`, `Human`, `Lifestyle`, `Plant`, `Scenery`, `Vehicles`.
- `prompts/metadata`: metadata for some prompt lists, such as the `color` and `object_class` labels for prompts that need to be semantically parsed.
